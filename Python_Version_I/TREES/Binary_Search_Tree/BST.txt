Binary search Tree follows all the properties of a binary tree and its left subtree contains value less than the node and the right subtree
contains the value greater than the node.
This hierarchical structure allows for efficient insertion, deletion and searching operations on the data stored in the tree

Properties of Binary Search Tree:
    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
    The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.  
    There must be no duplicate nodes(BST may have duplicate values with different handling approaches).

- Inorder traversal of a BST will print the nodes in increasing order
