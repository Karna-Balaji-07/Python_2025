Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property.
FOr every node the value of its children is greater than or equal to its own value

Heaps are always used to implement using priority queues where the smallest or largest element is always at the root.

Max-Heap:  The value of the root node must be the greatest among all its descendant nodes and the same thing must be done
 for its left and right sub-tree also. 

Min-Heap: The value of the root node must be the smallest among all its descendant nodes and the same thing must be done
 for its left and right sub-tree also.

The maximum or the minimum element is always at the root of the heap
The relationship between a parent node at index ‘i’ and its children is given by the formulas:
 left child at index 2i+1 and right child at index 2i+2 for 0-based indexing of node numbers.

When we insert an item, we insert it at the last available slot and then rearrange the nodes 
so that the heap property is maintained.

When we remove an item, we swap root with the last node to make sure either the max or min item is removed. 
Then we rearrange the remaining nodes to ensure heap property (max or min)

Heapify is the process of rearranging the elements to maintain the property of heap data structure.

for max heap, it makes sure the maximum element is the root of the binary tree and all the descendants follow the same property
for min heap , it balances in such a way that the minimum element is the root and all the descendants follow the same.

Time complexity for insertion is O(logn)
when we delete the element from the heap, it always deletes the root element of the tree and replaces it with last element
of the tree. Heapify operation is performed to maintain the property of heap
time complexity is O(logn)
