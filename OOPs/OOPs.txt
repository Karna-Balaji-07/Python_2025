CLASS : 
    - A class in Python is a user-defined template for creating objects. It bundles data and functions together, making it easier to manage and use them.
     When we create a new class, we define a new type of object. We can then create multiple instances of this object type.
    
    - Classes are created using class keyword. 
    - Attributes are variables defined inside the class and represent the properties of the class
    - An Object is an instance of a Class. It represents a specific implementation of the class and holds its own data.
    - In Python, class has __init__() function. It automatically initializes object attributes when an object is created.

    class Dog:
        species = "Canine"  # Class attribute

        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name  # Instance attribute
            self.age = age  # Instance attribute


    # Creating an object of the Dog class
    dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)

    print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy
    print(dog1.species)  # Output: Canine

    - self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. It allows us to access the attributes and methods of the object.
    - __str__ method in Python allows us to define a custom string representation of an object.
       
        def __str__(self):
            return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."  # Correct: Returning a string

    - class variables are variables that are shared across all instances of a class. It is defined at a class level, outside methods.
    - All objects of the class share the same value for a class variable unless explicitly overridden in an object.
    - Instance variables are unique to each instance (object) of a class.

    - Object consists of:
        State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
        Behavior: It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
        Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
