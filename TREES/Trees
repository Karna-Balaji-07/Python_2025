Binary Tree 
Binary Tree is a non-linear and hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children referred to as the left child
 and the right child.  The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and the bottom-most nodes are called leaves.

>> Each node in a binary tree has three parts:
    1.data
    2.Left pointer
    3.Right pointer

>> The topmost node is known as root node. It has no parent and serves as the starting points for all the nodes in the tree
>> The maximum number of nodes at level L of a binary tree is 2^L
>> The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height H is (2^H)-1
>>Total number of leaf nodes in a binary tree = total number of nodes with 2 children + 1                            

>> a full binary tree is a binary tree with either zero or two child nodes for each node.

BREADTH FIRST SEARCH ( BFS ) / LEVEL ORDER TRAVERSAL
- Level order traverses the tree in such a way that all the nodes in the same level are traversed before traversing the next level
- The main idea of level order traversal is to traverse all the nodes of a lower level before moving to any of the nodes of a higher level. 
- Level order traversal can be done either in stacks or queues

DEPTH FIRST SEARCH DFS
    - Inorder Traversal 
    - Preorder Traversal
    - Postorder Traversal

    => Inorder traversal is defined as a type of tree traversal technique which follows the Left-Root-Right pattern, such that:
        The left subtree is traversed first
        Then the root node for that subtree is traversed
        Finally, the right subtree is traversed
